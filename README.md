# sleeper-api-wrapper
A Python API wrapper for Sleeper Fantasy Football, as well as tools to simplify data received. It makes all endpoints found in the sleeper api docs: https://docs.sleeper.app/ available and turns the JSON response received into Python types for easy usage.

Ownership was transferred from @SwapnikKatkoori to @dtsong in March 2022 to continue efforts.
